Design and Screen Size :
This is a touch screen elevator control panel with a screen size of 4 inches

Interactive features :
This is an interactive design with the numbers and other useful information on the screen that will take you to the desired destination when u touch the screen

User feedback :
This is simple and helps people with a blind disability avoiding any dependencies

Code :
The code that is used to design this panel is html.

As mentioned earlier, this design supports people with blind disability by having a Braille content enabled on the screen. Initially, the screen looks like this without any Braille content.




Then we go for implementing a Braille overlay which is a label that can be sticked on the touch screen control panel.
Advantage - The biggest advantage of having this is that the blind people need not depend on others to use the elevator
The panel looks like this with a Braille overlay


The extra useful information on the screen here is, it displays
1. Location
2. Date & Time
3. Weather related information in the current location
